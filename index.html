		<h2> My Work </h2>
		
			<p> I've been working at a grocery store called Town and Country for about 2 years. </p>
			
		<h2> My Pets </h2>
			
			<p> I have way too many critters. </p>
			
		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
		
			<p> I love anything that involves music from going to concerts with friends to collecting vinyls. When I'm not hanging out with friends I like to spend time with my nephews. </p>
